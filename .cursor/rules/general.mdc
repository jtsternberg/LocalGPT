* Always use .editorconfig when creating new PHP files!
* Always create a test file FIRST with the failing tests, THEN create the actual (new) class/method.
   * Run tests after code is written.
* Be sure to update the [README.md](mdc:README.md), [ROADMAP.md](mdc:ROADMAP.md), [TODO.md](mdc:TODO.md) with corresponding changes in the code.
* To review Git Commits, ALWAYS prefer to use: `cat <<< "$(git show -p --no-color {ref})"`
